            <p>CascadingStyleSheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p><p><br>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects.</p> <br> CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides a powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>

            <header>Advantages of CSS</header>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>CSS saves time</strong>-Youcan write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many web pages as you want.</li>
                <li><strong>Pages  load  faster</strong> -If  you  are  using  CSS,  you  do  not  need  to  write  HTML  tag attributes  every  time.  Just  write  one  CSS  rule  of  a  tag  and  apply it to  all  the occurrences of that tag. So,less code means faster download times. </li>
                <li><strong>Easy maintenance</strong>-To make a global change, simply change the style, and all the elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Superior styles to HTML</strong>-CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML,so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Device Compatibility</strong>-Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website  can  be  presented  for  handheld  devices  such  as  PDAs  and  cellphones  or  for printing.</li>
                <li><strong>Global web standards</strong>–Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it’s a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="The_Type_Selectors">
            <header>The Type Selectors</header>
            <p>
                This is the same selector we have seen above. Again,one more example to give a color to all level 1 headings:
            </p>
            <code>h1 
                {
                    color:#36CFFF; 
                }</code>
        </section><br>
        <section class="main-section" id="The_Universal_Selectors"> 
            <header>The Universal Selectors</header>
            <p>
                Rather than selecting elements of a specific type, the universal selector quite simply matches the name of any element type: 
            </p>
            <code>
                * { color:#000000; }
            </code>
            <p>
                This rule renders the content of every element in our document in black.
            </p>
        </section><br>
        <section class="main-section" id="The_Descendant_Selectors">
            <header>The Descendant Selectors</header>
            <P>
                Suppose  you  want  to  apply  a  style  rule  to  a  particular  element  only  when  it  lies  inside  a particular  element.  As  given  in  the  following  example, the style  rule  will  apply  to  &lt;em&gt; element only when it lies insidethe &lt;ul&gt; tag.
            </P>
            <code>ul em {color:#000000; }</code>
        </section><br>
        <section class="main-section" id="The_Class_Selectors">
            <header>The Class Selectors</header>
            <p>
                You can define style rules based on the class attribute of the elements. All the elements having that class will be formatted according to the defined rule.
            </p>
            <code>
                .black {color:#000000; }     
            </code>
            <p>
                This rule renders the content in black for every element with class attribute set toblackin our document. You can make it a bit more particular. For example:
            </p>
            <code>
                h1.black {color:#000000; }
            </code>
            <p>
                This rule renders the content in black for only &lt;h1&gt; elements with class attribute set toblack.
            </p>
            <p>
                You  can  apply  more  than  one  class  selectors  to a given  element.  Consider  the  following example:
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;p class="center bold"&gt;This para will be styled by the classes center and bold. &lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
        </section>
